# ðŸ’° React Treasure Hunt Game

#### Overview

Treasure Hunt is the first project that students create at LEARN. During Jumpstart, treasure hunt is done with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this is a perfectly acceptable tech stack, using React allows for more advanced and dynamic code structures.

I have rebuilt my original treasure hunt project using React and have taken care to refactor and comment my code. I've also included some testing using testing-library.

#### Try It

To try running this yourself you can...
- Clone this repository
- `cd` into the repository
- Run $`yarn` to install the dependencies
- Run $`yarn start` to start the server
- Once the server is running you can run $`yarn test` in a new terminal or tab
